## Current version - 2.3

### 25-04-18: Major Project Update!

The biggest highlight: added support for ESP32-C3 modules (including Bluetooth!).

In addition, we’ve done extensive bug fixes, improved the GPS parser, and added support for hardware serial ports.

The main goal of these changes is to enhance compatibility with the new offline Lora Radar app, which now supports vector map caching and allows you to use the LoRa tracker even in areas without internet access.
